I feel the future is hopeless and that things cannot improve.
I feel I am a complete failure as a person.
I am dissatisfied or bored with everything.
I feel guilty all of the time.
I feel I am being punished.
I hate myself.
I blame myself for everything bad that happens.
I would kill myself if I had the chance.
I used to be able to cry but now I can't cry even though I want to.
I feel irritated all the time.
I have lost all of my interest in other people.
I can't make decisions at all anymore.
I believe that I look ugly.
I can't do any work at all.
I wake up several hours earlier than I used to and cannot get back to sleep.
I am too tired to do anything.
I have no appetite at all anymore.
